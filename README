Generic Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) ecosystem.

__Usage__
The GenericMainboard locally offers USB, ISP, and UART connections. These may be bridged to other network gateways including:
*) Desktop/Laptop Computer
*) Raspberry Pi
*) OpenWRT/Linux Router
*) Zigbee
*) Amateur Radio Gear

DB25F (parallel port) offers I2C and eleven ADC/IO pins. Simple peripherials may directly engage sensorimotor capabilities on the parallel port. More advanced peripherials may use the parallel port I2C connectivity with additional processors.

Additional peripherials are planned, including:
Parallel Port Hub
Stepper Driver
Camera

__Design__
USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__
Although EasyPLC components may be quite reliable, they do not automatically confer the redundancy and accuraccy required of safety-critical systems.

End users must always carefully consider failure points and reliability requirements.
